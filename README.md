# GestureTalk AI 🤟  
**AI-Powered Sign Language Interpreter, Translator & Learning Platform**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**GestureTalk AI** is an AI-powered web application designed to bridge communication and education gaps for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The platform performs **real-time sign language interpretation and translation** using computer vision and machine learning, while also providing a **sign-first learning ecosystem**.

Beyond interpretation, GestureTalk AI enables users to **learn sign language fundamentals**, track learning progress, access **mentor-led academic courses**, and receive guidance through an integrated AI chatbot — all through an accessible web interface.

## 🧠 System Architecture

GestureTalk AI follows a **clean, modular, and scalable client–server architecture**:

- **Frontend:**  
  Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
  Handles UI, webcam input, learning modules, chatbot interface, and progress tracking.

- **Backend:**  
  Developed in **Python using FastAPI**  
  Manages API requests, communicates with the AI model, and ensures fast response times.

- **AI / ML Model:**  
  Built using **Python, TensorFlow, and Keras**  
  Performs hand gesture recognition using computer vision techniques and maps gestures to text outputs.

This architecture ensures real-time performance, scalability, and maintainability.
